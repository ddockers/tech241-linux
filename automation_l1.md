`./new_script.sh` to run the script.

When writing the scrpt, we'd need to `cd` into the correct folder. To check where we're at we could include a `pwd` command. 

To make sure something in the script hs run, we could ad an `echo`.

Then go to VM and change inbound port rules. Destination port 3000 with Protocol TCP.
